# Original files

This script uses the following files from the UCI HAR dataset:
- `features.txt`: List of all available features.
- `activity_labels.txt`: Labels each class (1-6) to a specific activity (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying).
- `X_train.txt`: Train set.
- `y_train.txt`: Train labels.
- `subject_train.txt`: The subjects that generated the train data.
- `X_test.txt`: Test set.
- `y_test.txt`: Test labels.
- `subject_test.txt`: The subjects that generated the test data.

# Modifications of the original data

* Merging the train and the test sets into a big data set named `big_data`.
* Extracting only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and storing them into a new data set named `mean_std_data`.
* Using the `features.txt` to name all columns from `big_data`.
* Using the `activity_labels.txt` to label both `y_train.txt` and `y_test.txt` so instead of factors they have descriptive variable names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set `tidy_data` with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# 'tidydata.txt' description

The first column identifies the subject who performed the activities, range from 1 to 30.
The second column identifies the type of activity performed by the subject when the measurements were taken, options are: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying
From the third column to the 68th column, the average of every following measurement is displayed:
